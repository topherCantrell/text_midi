;  Octave modifiers are given next as + or - (or multiples of).
;  Octaves are carried over from note to note if not changed.
;  
;  Note durations are given next as numbers. 1 for whole, 2 for half,
;  4 for eighth, and so on. Note durations are carried over from note
;  to note if not changed.
;
;  Notes can be triplets or doublets by giving "t" or "d" after the length.
;
;  One or more dots can be given to make dotted note length.
;
;  The name of the note is A,B,C,D,E,F,G, or R for rest
;
;  After the letter can come "#" for sharp, "b" for flat, or "n" for natural. Unlike standard
;  music, accidentals do not carry through the remainder of the measure. They must appear on
;  every note.
;
;  A "~" on the end of the note indicates that it is tied into the next. If the next note is
;  the same then the duration is held out. If the next note is different the notes are slurred
;  together.
