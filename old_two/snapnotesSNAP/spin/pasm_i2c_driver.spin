'' PASM I2C Driver  Version 1.0
'' Copyright (c) 2010 Dave Hein
'' June 6, 2010
'' See end of file for terms of use

'' This is a PASM version of Mike Green's Basic I2C Driver.  The
'' low level I2C routines have been converted to PASM to increase the
'' I/O speed.  These routines use the same calling interface as
'' the Basic I2C Driver Version 1.1 in the OBEX, and should be fully
'' compatible with any existing code that uses the Basic I2C Driver.

'' Just like the Basic I2C Driver, the PASM I2C Driver assumes
'' that the SDA pin is one higher than the SCL pin.  It assumes that
'' neither the SDA nor the SCL pins have pullups, so drives both.

'' This object uses the Initialize method to start up a cog rather than using
'' the start method.  This is done to remain consistent with the Basic I2C
'' Driver routines.  Initialize must be called at the beginning of the program.
'' This loads the PASM code in a cog, and clocks the I2C bus to initialize
'' the devices on the bus.  Subsequent calls may be made to Initialize, and
'' it will not cause the cog to be stopped or reloaded.

'' The bus I/O speed is controlled by the constant DELAY_CYCLES.  This constant
'' is used in the delay routine.  The total delay consists of calling the delay
'' routine, performing a waitcnt of CNT + DELAY_CYCLES, and then returning
'' from the delay routine.  Therefore, the total delay will be about
'' 12 + DELAY_CYCLES.

'' The delay time represents the clock high time, and half the clock low time.
'' It is also used to determine the setup and hold times for the data bit for
'' read, write, start and stop operations.  DELAY_CYCLES is defined with a
'' value of 52, which gives a total delay of 64 cycles.  At 80 MHz, this is
'' 0.8 usecs, which is about one-third of a 400 KHz cycle time.  This value
'' should be modified to provide the optimal speed for a particular application.

'' Please see Mike Green's Basic I2C Driver object for more information on
'' the I2C routines, and on how EEPROMs are addressed
